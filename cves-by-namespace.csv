This issue may allow an attacker to create and amend files across the filesystem when applications are using the default ChrootOS, potentially allowing remote code execution. 
            STATEMENT: This problem only affects the go implementation and not the original git cli code. Applications using BoundOS or in-memory filesystems are not affected by this issue. Clients should be limited to connect to only trusted git servers to reduce the risk of compromise.
            MITIGATION: In cases where a bump to the latest version of go-git is not possible, a recommendation to reduce the exposure of this threat is limiting its use to only trust-worthy Git servers."

When a user inputs a domain which is in AllowedDomains, all domains starting with the same pattern are accepted. This issue could allow an attacker to break the CORS policy by allowing any page to make requests and retrieve data on behalf of users. 
            STATEMENT: The go-restful package is a transitive dependency which is being pulled with k8s.io/api and not directly being used anywhere in OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), OpenShift Container Storage and OpenShift Data Foundation, hence these components are marked as 'Will not fix' or even ""Not affected""."

Homoglyphs are different Unicode characters that, to the naked eye, look the same.  An attacker could use homoglyphs to deceive a human reviewer by creating a malicious patch containing functions that look similar to standard library functions, such as print, but replace one character with a homoglyph. This function can then be defined in an upstream dependency to launch source code-related attacks. 
            STATEMENT: This is a flaw with the way unicode standards are implemented in the context of development environments, which have specialized requirements for rendering text. It is not a flaw in Red Hat products."

The did_set_langmap function in map.c calls sprintf to write to the error buffer that is passed down to the option callback functions. That buffer can be overflown, possibly leading to memory corruption and escalation of privileges. 
            STATEMENT: Escalation of privilege may only be attained if the Vim binary can be run with non-default higher privileges, which is a rare scenario, for example, setuid. Hence, the Moderate severity."
aap,cluster,,aap,CVE-2019-17543,Not Fixable,Moderate,8.1,14%,5.90,,2024-02-28T06:55:10.883770178Z,https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-17543,"DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: LZ4 before 1.9.2 has a heap-based buffer overflow in LZ4_write32 (related to LZ4_compress_destSize), affecting applications that call LZ4_compress_fast with a large input. (This issue can also lead to data corruption.) NOTE: the vendor states ""only a few specific / uncommon usages of the API are at risk."" 
            STATEMENT: As per upstream this flaw cannot be exploited under normal documented use of the LZ4 library API. Also this flaw is only present in the lz4 library and the application binaries shipped with this application are not affected by it. 

Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 packages an older version of lz4 that has the flawed code. However, because OpenStack has been using RHEL's updated lz4 version since RHEL7.5 started to include it, Red Hat is not currently updating the OpenStack lz4 package."

This flaw allows a local attacker to use a specially designed text file to read and write files outside of the container's scope. 
            STATEMENT: Because Red Hat OpenStack Platform's director-operator does not use hostPath volumes, the RHOSP Impact has been rated Low impact and no updates will be provided at this time for its containers.

In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) the containerd package is not actually used, but because the containerd API is supported the core OCP components are listed as affected by this CVE and the impact is reduced to Low."

The software installs the version with the highest version number, even if the user had intended to obtain a private package from a private index. This only affects use of the --extra-index-url option, and exploitation requires that the package does not already exist in the public index (and thus the attacker can put the package there with an arbitrary version number). 
            STATEMENT: Although this issue affects versions of pip shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat Software Collections and Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces, Red Hat Product Security does not consider this to be a security vulnerability because per the pip documentation, this is intended behavior of pip when using the --extra-index-url flag. Therefore, this issue has been marked WONTFIX.
            MITIGATION: To protect from any unintended behavior,  use --index-url and do not use --extra-index-url OR explicitly set --index-url and use --extra-index-url."
aap,cluster,,aap,CVE-2020-15778,Not Fixable,Moderate,7.8,1%,5.90,,2024-02-27T03:55:44.176965891Z,https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-15778,"DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the scp program shipped with the openssh-clients package. An attacker having the ability to scp files to a remote server, could execute arbitrary commands on the remote server by including the command as a part of the filename being copied on the server. This command is run with the permissions of user with which the files were copied on the remote server. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. 
            STATEMENT: This security flaw lies in the way scp command parses its command line arguments. The SSH protocol or any other applications shipped as a part of openssh-clients packages are not vulnerable.

In order to exploit this flaw, the attacker needs to social engineer or manipulate a system administrator (who has root access on the remote server)  to run scp with a malicious command line parameter. 

Administrators can uninstall openssh-clients for additional protection against accidental usage of this binary. Removing the openssh-clients package will make binaries like scp and ssh etc unavailable on that system. Also administrators can change the execute permissions on the scp binary. However this mitigation will be in place until the openssh-clients package is updated.
            MITIGATION: As per upstream, because of the way scp is based on a historical protocol called rcp which relies on that style of argument passing and therefore encounters expansion problems. Making changes to how the scp command line works breaks the pattern used by scp consumers. Upstream therefore recommends the use of rsync in the place of scp for better security.

A local unprivileged attacker can abuse this flaw to crash systemd services or potentially execute code and elevate their privileges, by sending specially crafted dbus messages. 
            STATEMENT: This issue did not affect the versions of systemd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 as there is no service that performs asynchronous polkit requests in a vulnerable way.

The version of systemd delivered in OpenShift Container Platform 4.1 and included in CoreOS images has been superseded by the version delivered in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. CoreOS updates for systemd in will be consumed from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 channels."

When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result, attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites that allow users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. 
            STATEMENT: The CVE-2024-24806 vulnerability in libuv, can be classified as a moderate severity issue rather than critical due to several mitigating factors. Firstly, the exploit requires specific conditions to be met, including the use of hostnames exceeding 256 characters, limiting its applicability. Additionally, the vulnerability primarily exposes servers to SSRF attacks and unauthorized access to internal APIs, rather than facilitating direct system compromise or data exfiltration. Furthermore, the exploit's detection and exploitation require a degree of sophistication, reducing the likelihood of widespread exploitation. While the potential impact on systems leveraging libuv is notable, prudent security measures, such as network controls and vigilant monitoring, can effectively mitigate the risk, thus warranting a moderate severity classification.

When common types of DRAM memory are used, it might allow row hammer attacks because the integer value of authenticated authpassword does not resist flips of a single bit. 
            STATEMENT: ""Mayhem"" is a potent attack technique that focuses on the core components of computing systems, specifically the CPU internals and stack variables. This method signifies a noteworthy advancement in cyber threats, demonstrating the ability to tamper with a computer's memory and compromise both stack and register variables. Capitalizing on the well-known Rowhammer effect, where swift access to a DRAM row induces bit flips in neighboring rows, this attack exploits these bit flips to disrupt stack variables and manipulate register values within a given process. The manipulation is accomplished by targeting register values stored in the process' stack, which, once flushed out to memory, become vulnerable to Rowhammer attacks. When reloaded, these corrupted values cause chaos, compromising the integrity of the entire process. It's important to note that this attack is confined to the local system, leading us to categorize it as a moderate threat.

The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection. 
            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in the libssh abstract layer for message digest operations is deemed to have a low impact due to several mitigating factors. Primarily, the absence of proper checks on return values from supported crypto backends may lead to low-memory situations, failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or the utilization of uninitialized memory in the Key Derivation Function (KDF). While these potential consequences could disrupt the system, their likelihood is considered low, contributing to the low impact classification.

The maintainers of libssh, in conjunction with Red Hat, have assigned a CVSS3.1 score of 3.7 to this vulnerability. While the score acknowledges the existence of a vulnerability, the assigned value falls within the lower range of the scale, indicating a relatively modest level of risk.

Moreover, the practical exploitability of this vulnerability is characterized as theoretical and highly unlikely to yield tangible results. The difficulty in successfully exploiting the flaw adds a layer of security, further diminishing the potential impact. While acknowledging the risk of non-matching keys leading to decryption/integrity failures and connection termination, the combination of the low likelihood of exploitation and the relatively lower severity score results in an overall assessment of low impact.

When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result, attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites that allow users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. 
            STATEMENT: The CVE-2024-24806 vulnerability in libuv, can be classified as a moderate severity issue rather than critical due to several mitigating factors. Firstly, the exploit requires specific conditions to be met, including the use of hostnames exceeding 256 characters, limiting its applicability. Additionally, the vulnerability primarily exposes servers to SSRF attacks and unauthorized access to internal APIs, rather than facilitating direct system compromise or data exfiltration. Furthermore, the exploit's detection and exploitation require a degree of sophistication, reducing the likelihood of widespread exploitation. While the potential impact on systems leveraging libuv is notable, prudent security measures, such as network controls and vigilant monitoring, can effectively mitigate the risk, thus warranting a moderate severity classification.

Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks. OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks silently ignore invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates that are skipped for that certificate. A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether. Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

The X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function is documented to enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate verification implicitly. However, implementing the function does not enable the check, allowing certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass the certificate verification. Suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments, so it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function. The applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument. Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not commonly used by applications."

The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection. 
            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in the libssh abstract layer for message digest operations is deemed to have a low impact due to several mitigating factors. Primarily, the absence of proper checks on return values from supported crypto backends may lead to low-memory situations, failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or the utilization of uninitialized memory in the Key Derivation Function (KDF). While these potential consequences could disrupt the system, their likelihood is considered low, contributing to the low impact classification.

The maintainers of libssh, in conjunction with Red Hat, have assigned a CVSS3.1 score of 3.7 to this vulnerability. While the score acknowledges the existence of a vulnerability, the assigned value falls within the lower range of the scale, indicating a relatively modest level of risk.

Moreover, the practical exploitability of this vulnerability is characterized as theoretical and highly unlikely to yield tangible results. The difficulty in successfully exploiting the flaw adds a layer of security, further diminishing the potential impact. While acknowledging the risk of non-matching keys leading to decryption/integrity failures and connection termination, the combination of the low likelihood of exploitation and the relatively lower severity score results in an overall assessment of low impact.

Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks.

A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether.

The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection. 
            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in the libssh abstract layer for message digest operations is deemed to have a low impact due to several mitigating factors. Primarily, the absence of proper checks on return values from supported crypto backends may lead to low-memory situations, failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or the utilization of uninitialized memory in the Key Derivation Function (KDF). While these potential consequences could disrupt the system, their likelihood is considered low, contributing to the low impact classification.

The maintainers of libssh, in conjunction with Red Hat, have assigned a CVSS3.1 score of 3.7 to this vulnerability. While the score acknowledges the existence of a vulnerability, the assigned value falls within the lower range of the scale, indicating a relatively modest level of risk.

Moreover, the practical exploitability of this vulnerability is characterized as theoretical and highly unlikely to yield tangible results. The difficulty in successfully exploiting the flaw adds a layer of security, further diminishing the potential impact. While acknowledging the risk of non-matching keys leading to decryption/integrity failures and connection termination, the combination of the low likelihood of exploitation and the relatively lower severity score results in an overall assessment of low impact.

The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection. 
            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in the libssh abstract layer for message digest operations is deemed to have a low impact due to several mitigating factors. Primarily, the absence of proper checks on return values from supported crypto backends may lead to low-memory situations, failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or the utilization of uninitialized memory in the Key Derivation Function (KDF). While these potential consequences could disrupt the system, their likelihood is considered low, contributing to the low impact classification.

The maintainers of libssh, in conjunction with Red Hat, have assigned a CVSS3.1 score of 3.7 to this vulnerability. While the score acknowledges the existence of a vulnerability, the assigned value falls within the lower range of the scale, indicating a relatively modest level of risk.

Moreover, the practical exploitability of this vulnerability is characterized as theoretical and highly unlikely to yield tangible results. The difficulty in successfully exploiting the flaw adds a layer of security, further diminishing the potential impact. While acknowledging the risk of non-matching keys leading to decryption/integrity failures and connection termination, the combination of the low likelihood of exploitation and the relatively lower severity score results in an overall assessment of low impact.

When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result, attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites that allow users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. 
            STATEMENT: The CVE-2024-24806 vulnerability in libuv, can be classified as a moderate severity issue rather than critical due to several mitigating factors. Firstly, the exploit requires specific conditions to be met, including the use of hostnames exceeding 256 characters, limiting its applicability. Additionally, the vulnerability primarily exposes servers to SSRF attacks and unauthorized access to internal APIs, rather than facilitating direct system compromise or data exfiltration. Furthermore, the exploit's detection and exploitation require a degree of sophistication, reducing the likelihood of widespread exploitation. While the potential impact on systems leveraging libuv is notable, prudent security measures, such as network controls and vigilant monitoring, can effectively mitigate the risk, thus warranting a moderate severity classification.

The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection. 
            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in the libssh abstract layer for message digest operations is deemed to have a low impact due to several mitigating factors. Primarily, the absence of proper checks on return values from supported crypto backends may lead to low-memory situations, failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or the utilization of uninitialized memory in the Key Derivation Function (KDF). While these potential consequences could disrupt the system, their likelihood is considered low, contributing to the low impact classification.

The maintainers of libssh, in conjunction with Red Hat, have assigned a CVSS3.1 score of 3.7 to this vulnerability. While the score acknowledges the existence of a vulnerability, the assigned value falls within the lower range of the scale, indicating a relatively modest level of risk.

Moreover, the practical exploitability of this vulnerability is characterized as theoretical and highly unlikely to yield tangible results. The difficulty in successfully exploiting the flaw adds a layer of security, further diminishing the potential impact. While acknowledging the risk of non-matching keys leading to decryption/integrity failures and connection termination, the combination of the low likelihood of exploitation and the relatively lower severity score results in an overall assessment of low impact.

An attacker having the ability to scp files to a remote server, could execute arbitrary commands on the remote server by including the command as a part of the filename being copied on the server. This command is run with the permissions of user with which the files were copied on the remote server. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. 
            STATEMENT: This security flaw lies in the way scp command parses its command line arguments. The SSH protocol or any other applications shipped as a part of openssh-clients packages are not vulnerable.

In order to exploit this flaw, the attacker needs to social engineer or manipulate a system administrator (who has root access on the remote server)  to run scp with a malicious command line parameter. 

Administrators can uninstall openssh-clients for additional protection against accidental usage of this binary. Removing the openssh-clients package will make binaries like scp and ssh etc unavailable on that system. Also administrators can change the execute permissions on the scp binary. However this mitigation will be in place until the openssh-clients package is updated.
            MITIGATION: As per upstream, because of the way scp is based on a historical protocol called rcp which relies on that style of argument passing and therefore encounters expansion problems. Making changes to how the scp command line works breaks the pattern used by scp consumers. Upstream therefore recommends the use of rsync in the place of scp for better security.

When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result, attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites that allow users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. 
            STATEMENT: The CVE-2024-24806 vulnerability in libuv, can be classified as a moderate severity issue rather than critical due to several mitigating factors. Firstly, the exploit requires specific conditions to be met, including the use of hostnames exceeding 256 characters, limiting its applicability. Additionally, the vulnerability primarily exposes servers to SSRF attacks and unauthorized access to internal APIs, rather than facilitating direct system compromise or data exfiltration. Furthermore, the exploit's detection and exploitation require a degree of sophistication, reducing the likelihood of widespread exploitation. While the potential impact on systems leveraging libuv is notable, prudent security measures, such as network controls and vigilant monitoring, can effectively mitigate the risk, thus warranting a moderate severity classification.
            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability."

When common types of DRAM memory are used, it might allow row hammer attacks because the integer value of authenticated authpassword does not resist flips of a single bit. 
            STATEMENT: ""Mayhem"" is a potent attack technique that focuses on the core components of computing systems, specifically the CPU internals and stack variables. This method signifies a noteworthy advancement in cyber threats, demonstrating the ability to tamper with a computer's memory and compromise both stack and register variables. Capitalizing on the well-known Rowhammer effect, where swift access to a DRAM row induces bit flips in neighboring rows, this attack exploits these bit flips to disrupt stack variables and manipulate register values within a given process. The manipulation is accomplished by targeting register values stored in the process' stack, which, once flushed out to memory, become vulnerable to Rowhammer attacks. When reloaded, these corrupted values cause chaos, compromising the integrity of the entire process. It's important to note that this attack is confined to the local system, leading us to categorize it as a moderate threat.
            MITIGATION: To address this issue, it's crucial to implement robust logic that prevents unintended execution from a single-bit flip.

Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks. OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks silently ignore invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates that are skipped for that certificate. A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether. Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

Suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments, so it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function. The applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument.

The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection. 
            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in the libssh abstract layer for message digest operations is deemed to have a low impact due to several mitigating factors. Primarily, the absence of proper checks on return values from supported crypto backends may lead to low-memory situations, failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or the utilization of uninitialized memory in the Key Derivation Function (KDF). While these potential consequences could disrupt the system, their likelihood is considered low, contributing to the low impact classification.

The maintainers of libssh, in conjunction with Red Hat, have assigned a CVSS3.1 score of 3.7 to this vulnerability. While the score acknowledges the existence of a vulnerability, the assigned value falls within the lower range of the scale, indicating a relatively modest level of risk.

Moreover, the practical exploitability of this vulnerability is characterized as theoretical and highly unlikely to yield tangible results. The difficulty in successfully exploiting the flaw adds a layer of security, further diminishing the potential impact. While acknowledging the risk of non-matching keys leading to decryption/integrity failures and connection termination, the combination of the low likelihood of exploitation and the relatively lower severity score results in an overall assessment of low impact.

            STATEMENT: This vulnerability allows for a denial of service attack to be performed against applications that process  untrusted GVariant input, compromising application availability by consuming excessive processing time or utilizing a large quantity of memory. The most likely threat is from a local user, which may be possible depending on the configuration of the service and the format of parameters that it expects. While a remote attack is possible if the application is configured to read GVariants over a network connection, this is not the default configuration which makes the likelihood low.

When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result, attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites that allow users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. 
            STATEMENT: The CVE-2024-24806 vulnerability in libuv, can be classified as a moderate severity issue rather than critical due to several mitigating factors. Firstly, the exploit requires specific conditions to be met, including the use of hostnames exceeding 256 characters, limiting its applicability. Additionally, the vulnerability primarily exposes servers to SSRF attacks and unauthorized access to internal APIs, rather than facilitating direct system compromise or data exfiltration. Furthermore, the exploit's detection and exploitation require a degree of sophistication, reducing the likelihood of widespread exploitation. While the potential impact on systems leveraging libuv is notable, prudent security measures, such as network controls and vigilant monitoring, can effectively mitigate the risk, thus warranting a moderate severity classification.

This flaw allows an attacker to trick the user into submitting a request that could perform actions as the user, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and system integrity.

Due to implementation details one cannot use this flaw for reflection of a cookie representing already logged-in user. An attacker would always have to go through a new authentication attempt. 
            STATEMENT: The CSRF vulnerability in ipa/session/login_password is considered a moderate issue due to the need for the attacker to trick users into submitting a request. This implies that exploitation requires user interaction for a new authentication attempt, rather than reflecting a cookie for an already logged-in user. While the vulnerability could result in a loss of confidentiality and system integrity, the specific actions and their severity are not explicitly detailed. The moderate classification suggests that, while serious, the limitations on exploitation conditions and potential impact contribute to a moderate overall severity.

Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks. OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks silently ignore invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates that are skipped for that certificate. A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether. Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

The X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function is documented to enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate verification implicitly.

Suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments, so it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function. The applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument.

The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection. 
            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in the libssh abstract layer for message digest operations is deemed to have a low impact due to several mitigating factors. Primarily, the absence of proper checks on return values from supported crypto backends may lead to low-memory situations, failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or the utilization of uninitialized memory in the Key Derivation Function (KDF). While these potential consequences could disrupt the system, their likelihood is considered low, contributing to the low impact classification.

The maintainers of libssh, in conjunction with Red Hat, have assigned a CVSS3.1 score of 3.7 to this vulnerability. While the score acknowledges the existence of a vulnerability, the assigned value falls within the lower range of the scale, indicating a relatively modest level of risk.

Moreover, the practical exploitability of this vulnerability is characterized as theoretical and highly unlikely to yield tangible results. The difficulty in successfully exploiting the flaw adds a layer of security, further diminishing the potential impact. While acknowledging the risk of non-matching keys leading to decryption/integrity failures and connection termination, the combination of the low likelihood of exploitation and the relatively lower severity score results in an overall assessment of low impact.

This flaw allows an attacker to trick the user into submitting a request that could perform actions as the user, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and system integrity. During community penetration testing it was found that for certain HTTP end-points FreeIPA does not ensure CSRF protection. Due to implementation details one cannot use this flaw for reflection of a cookie representing already logged-in user. An attacker would always have to go through a new authentication attempt. 
            STATEMENT: The CSRF vulnerability in ipa/session/login_password is considered a moderate issue due to the need for the attacker to trick users into submitting a request. This implies that exploitation requires user interaction for a new authentication attempt, rather than reflecting a cookie for an already logged-in user. While the vulnerability could result in a loss of confidentiality and system integrity, the specific actions and their severity are not explicitly detailed.

The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection. 
            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in the libssh abstract layer for message digest operations is deemed to have a low impact due to several mitigating factors. Primarily, the absence of proper checks on return values from supported crypto backends may lead to low-memory situations, failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or the utilization of uninitialized memory in the Key Derivation Function (KDF). While these potential consequences could disrupt the system, their likelihood is considered low, contributing to the low impact classification.

The maintainers of libssh, in conjunction with Red Hat, have assigned a CVSS3.1 score of 3.7 to this vulnerability. While the score acknowledges the existence of a vulnerability, the assigned value falls within the lower range of the scale, indicating a relatively modest level of risk.

Moreover, the practical exploitability of this vulnerability is characterized as theoretical and highly unlikely to yield tangible results. The difficulty in successfully exploiting the flaw adds a layer of security, further diminishing the potential impact. While acknowledging the risk of non-matching keys leading to decryption/integrity failures and connection termination, the combination of the low likelihood of exploitation and the relatively lower severity score results in an overall assessment of low impact.

Primarily, the absence of proper checks on return values from supported crypto backends may lead to low-memory situations, failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or the utilization of uninitialized memory in the Key Derivation Function (KDF). While these potential consequences could disrupt the system, their likelihood is considered low, contributing to the low impact classification.

The maintainers of libssh, in conjunction with Red Hat, have assigned a CVSS3.1 score of 3.7 to this vulnerability. While the score acknowledges the existence of a vulnerability, the assigned value falls within the lower range of the scale, indicating a relatively modest level of risk.

Moreover, the practical exploitability of this vulnerability is characterized as theoretical and highly unlikely to yield tangible results. The difficulty in successfully exploiting the flaw adds a layer of security, further diminishing the potential impact. While acknowledging the risk of non-matching keys leading to decryption/integrity failures and connection termination, the combination of the low likelihood of exploitation and the relatively lower severity score results in an overall assessment of low impact.
            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability."

When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result, attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites that allow users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. 
            STATEMENT: The CVE-2024-24806 vulnerability in libuv, can be classified as a moderate severity issue rather than critical due to several mitigating factors. Firstly, the exploit requires specific conditions to be met, including the use of hostnames exceeding 256 characters, limiting its applicability. Additionally, the vulnerability primarily exposes servers to SSRF attacks and unauthorized access to internal APIs, rather than facilitating direct system compromise or data exfiltration. Furthermore, the exploit's detection and exploitation require a degree of sophistication, reducing the likelihood of widespread exploitation. While the potential impact on systems leveraging libuv is notable, prudent security measures, such as network controls and vigilant monitoring, can effectively mitigate the risk, thus warranting a moderate severity classification.

This flaw allows a remote attacker to pass specially crafted data to the application, initiating an integer overflow and executing a denial of service (DoS) attack. 
            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security classifies this issue as having a Low security impact. The vulnerability involves an infinite loop in a command-line utility, which is not typically designed to handle untrusted input. As a result, it is assessed that this does not pose a substantial security risk and does not lead to any meaningful security impact.

Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks. OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks silently ignore invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates that are skipped for that certificate. A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether. Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

The X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function is documented to enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate verification implicitly. However, implementing the function does not enable the check, allowing certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass the certificate verification. Suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments, so it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function. The applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument. Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not commonly used by applications."

Attackers can exploit this flaw to bypass filtering or execute arbitrary code by crafting a path like /~2/foo while accessing a server with a specific user. 
            STATEMENT: In a containerized environment running SELinux in enforcing mode, such as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, this vulnerability does not allow an attacker to escape the boundary of a container. In this case no additional access is gained, there is an additional (but more complicated step) to look at files the user already has access to.

The upstream project (Curl) also rated this CVE as Low, see link in External References.

It is unlikely that Red Hat offerings are utilizing the SFTP feature of Curl, so the opportunity to exploit it may not exist. For those reasons Red Hat Product Security rates the impact as Low."

The return values from these were not properly checked, which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF. In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity failures, terminating the connection. 
            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in the libssh abstract layer for message digest operations is deemed to have a low impact due to several mitigating factors. Primarily, the absence of proper checks on return values from supported crypto backends may lead to low-memory situations, failures, NULL dereferences, crashes, or the utilization of uninitialized memory in the Key Derivation Function (KDF). While these potential consequences could disrupt the system, their likelihood is considered low, contributing to the low impact classification.

The maintainers of libssh, in conjunction with Red Hat, have assigned a CVSS3.1 score of 3.7 to this vulnerability. While the score acknowledges the existence of a vulnerability, the assigned value falls within the lower range of the scale, indicating a relatively modest level of risk.

Moreover, the practical exploitability of this vulnerability is characterized as theoretical and highly unlikely to yield tangible results. The difficulty in successfully exploiting the flaw adds a layer of security, further diminishing the potential impact. While acknowledging the risk of non-matching keys leading to decryption/integrity failures and connection termination, the combination of the low likelihood of exploitation and the relatively lower severity score results in an overall assessment of low impact.
