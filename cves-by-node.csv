When processing an IP packet with protocol 0, OVS will install the datapath flow without the action modifying the IP header. This issue results (for both kernel and userspace datapath) in installing a datapath flow matching all IP protocols (nw_proto is wildcarded) for this flow, but with an incorrect action, possibly causing incorrect handling of other IP packets with a != 0 IP protocol that matches this dp flow. 
            STATEMENT: In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) the openvswitch rpm package is consumed from the RHEL Fast Datapath repositories, hence OCP openvswitch components are marked as ""Will not fix"".
            MITIGATION: For any version of Open vSwitch, preventing packets with network
protocol number '0' from reaching Open vSwitch will prevent the issue.
This is difficult to achieve because Open vSwitch obtains packets before
the iptables or nftables host firewall, so iptables or nftables on the
Open vSwitch host cannot ordinarily block the vulnerability.

Another method would be to add a high priority flow to the flow table
explicitly matching on nw protocol '0' and handling that traffic
separately:

   table=0 priority=32768,ip,ip_proto=0 actions=drop

This would need to be similarly done for IPv6 traffic as well."

The versions of Ruby as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Software Collections 3 do not use Oniguruma but rather Onigmo, a regular expressions library forked from Oniguruma focusing on new expressions supported in Perl 5.10+. Those versions are affected by this flaw because both Onigmo and Oniguruma share the same vulnerable code.

By manipulating sequence numbers during the handshake, an attacker can remove the initial messages on the secure channel without causing a MAC failure. For example, an attacker could disable the ping extension and thus disable the new countermeasure in OpenSSH 9.5 against keystroke timing attacks. 
            STATEMENT: This CVE is classified as moderate because the attack requires an active Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) who can intercept and modify the connection's traffic at the TCP/IP layer.

Although the attack is cryptographically innovative, its security impact is fortunately quite limited. It only allows the deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this protocol stage prevents user authentication from proceeding, leading to a stalled connection.

The most significant identified impact is that it enables a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication begins. This allows the attacker to disable a subset of keystroke timing obfuscation features. However, there is no other observable impact on session secrecy or session integrity.
            MITIGATION: As an alternate less invasive countermeasure, the affected cipher modes chacha20-poly1305 and any encrypt-then-mac variants (generic EtM) may be (temporarily) disabled. Some cipher modes, in particular AES-GCM, are not affected and can still be used without changes.


You can disable the following ciphers and HMACs as a workaround  on RHEL-8 and RHEL-9:
1. chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com
2. hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com
3. hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com
4. hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com
5. hmac-md5-etm@openssh.com

To do that through crypto-policies, one can apply a subpolicy with the following content:
```
cipher@SSH = -CHACHA20-POLY1305
ssh_etm = 0
```
e.g., by putting these lines into `/etc/crypto-policies/policies/modules/CVE-2023-48795.pmod`, applying the resulting subpolicy with `update-crypto-policies --set $(update-crypto-policies --show):CVE-2023-48795` and restarting openssh server.

One can verify that the changes are in effect by ensuring the ciphers listed above are missing from both `/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config` and `/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensshserver.config`.

For more details on using crypto-policies, please refer to https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/using-the-system-wide-cryptographic-policies_security-hardening

Note that this procedure does limit the interoperability of the host and is only suggested as a temporary mitigation until the issue is fully resolved with an update.

For RHEL-7: 
We can recommend to use strict MACs and Ciphers on RHEL7 in both files /etc/ssh/ssh_config and /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

Below strict set of Ciphers and MACs can be used as mitigation for RHEL 7.

```
Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com
MACs umac-64@openssh.com,umac-128@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512
```

OR

Remove the chacha cipher and etm macs from both config options which are currently configured.
```
ssh -Q cipher
ssh -Q mac

When processing an IP packet with protocol 0, OVS will install the datapath flow without the action modifying the IP header. This issue results (for both kernel and userspace datapath) in installing a datapath flow matching all IP protocols (nw_proto is wildcarded) for this flow, but with an incorrect action, possibly causing incorrect handling of other IP packets with a != 0 IP protocol that matches this dp flow.

            MITIGATION: For any version of Open vSwitch, preventing packets with network
protocol number '0' from reaching Open vSwitch will prevent the issue.
This is difficult to achieve because Open vSwitch obtains packets before
the iptables or nftables host firewall, so iptables or nftables on the
Open vSwitch host cannot ordinarily block the vulnerability.

Another method would be to add a high priority flow to the flow table
explicitly matching on nw protocol '0' and handling that traffic
separately:

   table=0 priority=32768,ip,ip_proto=0 actions=drop

This would need to be similarly done for IPv6 traffic as well."

By manipulating sequence numbers during the handshake, an attacker can remove the initial messages on the secure channel without causing a MAC failure. For example, an attacker could disable the ping extension and thus disable the new countermeasure in OpenSSH 9.5 against keystroke timing attacks. 
            STATEMENT: This CVE is classified as moderate because the attack requires an active Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) who can intercept and modify the connection's traffic at the TCP/IP layer.

Although the attack is cryptographically innovative, its security impact is fortunately quite limited. It only allows the deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this protocol stage prevents user authentication from proceeding, leading to a stalled connection.

The most significant identified impact is that it enables a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication begins. This allows the attacker to disable a subset of keystroke timing obfuscation features. However, there is no other observable impact on session secrecy or session integrity.
            MITIGATION: As an alternate less invasive countermeasure, the affected cipher modes chacha20-poly1305 and any encrypt-then-mac variants (generic EtM) may be (temporarily) disabled. Some cipher modes, in particular AES-GCM, are not affected and can still be used without changes.


You can disable the following ciphers and HMACs as a workaround  on RHEL-8 and RHEL-9:
1. chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com
2. hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com
3. hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com
4. hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com
5. hmac-md5-etm@openssh.com

To do that through crypto-policies, one can apply a subpolicy with the following content:
```
cipher@SSH = -CHACHA20-POLY1305
ssh_etm = 0
```
e.g., by putting these lines into `/etc/crypto-policies/policies/modules/CVE-2023-48795.pmod`, applying the resulting subpolicy with `update-crypto-policies --set $(update-crypto-policies --show):CVE-2023-48795` and restarting openssh server.

One can verify that the changes are in effect by ensuring the ciphers listed above are missing from both `/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config` and `/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensshserver.config`.

For more details on using crypto-policies, please refer to https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/using-the-system-wide-cryptographic-policies_security-hardening

Note that this procedure does limit the interoperability of the host and is only suggested as a temporary mitigation until the issue is fully resolved with an update.

For RHEL-7: 
We can recommend to use strict MACs and Ciphers on RHEL7 in both files /etc/ssh/ssh_config and /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

Below strict set of Ciphers and MACs can be used as mitigation for RHEL 7.

```
Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com
MACs umac-64@openssh.com,umac-128@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512
```

OR

Remove the chacha cipher and etm macs from both config options which are currently configured.
```
ssh -Q cipher
ssh -Q mac
sshd -T | grep -e '^ciphers ' -e '^macs '

This issue affects an application using this package if these conditions are met: (1) it relies only on the return error of the Bind function call to determine whether a user is authorized (i.e., a nil return value is interpreted as successful authorization) and (2) it is used with an LDAP server allowing unauthenticated bind. 
            STATEMENT: This issues affects the version of go-ldap/ldap with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.11. However OpenShift explicitly checks for blank passwords in order to prevent anonymous LDAP binds. As the OpenShift 3.11 product packages the vulnerable library, it is affected, but is set to wontfix. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having security impact of Moderate. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.

The 'oc cli' in OCP 3.11 and 4.x also contains the vulnerable go-ldap/ldap library. However, while the oc binary does allow anonymous binds any unauthenticated binds are not possible. Hence the oc cli is marked affected (as it includes the library), but is set to wontfix - this may be addressed in a future release."
