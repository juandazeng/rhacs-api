This issue occurs when the e-Tugra root certificate in Certifi is removed, resulting in an unspecified error that has an unknown impact and attack vector. 
            STATEMENT: While eTurgra certificates being marked as untrusted by Mozilla is significant from a trust and security standpoint, this is still considered a low severity issue. The certificates were removed from Mozilla's root store in July 2023, indicating a proactive response to security concerns. Additionally, Red Hat does not run its own root store program, but depends on Mozilla for ssl certificates and Microsoft for signing certificates. 
These certs are included and marked as don't trust and will not be removed until Mozilla removes them. Browsers are most at risk, which already understand and parse 'don't trust after'. If python-fi is required not to trust these certs, they should parse the 'don't trust after' attribute."

            STATEMENT: This CVE is under investigation by Red Hat Product Security.

Note: Upstream would categorize this as a simple bug, not a security issue. Since most elfutils tools are run in short-lived, local, interactive, development contexts rather than remotely ""in production"", we generally treat malfunctions as ordinary bugs rather than security vulnerabilities.
The version, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, is not affected by this vulnerability."

This vulnerability occurs within the handle_verdef() function in the readelf.c source file. A NULL pointer dereference typically happens when a program attempts to access memory using a pointer that is not pointing anywhere (i.e., it's NULL), leading to a crash or potentially exploitable behavior. 
            STATEMENT: This incident was classified as a standard bug rather than a security concern. Crashes in standalone utilities triggered by untrusted inputs typically aren't regarded as security issues since they don't lead to privilege escalation. It's important to highlight that unless eu-readelf is instrumented with AddressSanitizer, no actual crash occurs; instead, eu-readelf simply prints a random global string.
            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability."

            STATEMENT: This vulnerability allows for a denial of service attack to be performed against applications that process  untrusted GVariant input, compromising application availability by consuming excessive processing time or utilizing a large quantity of memory. The most likely threat is from a local user, which may be possible depending on the configuration of the service and the format of parameters that it expects. While a remote attack is possible if the application is configured to read GVariants over a network connection, this is not the default configuration which makes the likelihood low. Because the most widely available attack vector is local and the consequences are limited to denial of service, Red Hat Product Security rates the impact as Low."

A malicious, authenticated service principal allowed to delegate could use this flaw to impersonate a non-forwardable user. 
            STATEMENT: As a prerequisite to be vulnerable, a Key Distribution Center (KDC) must be able to accept delegation via the `Service for User` (S4U) extensions.

Version of MIT Kerberos KDC in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (provided by the krb5-server package) only allows use of the S4U extensions when configured with an LDAP backend. Furthermore, delegations are denied by default and delegation rules must be explicitly created by an administrator, between a given service principal and its targets. Such a rule would entitle that service to use delegation to the targets.  This means that, in order to exploit the flaw, an attacker would require either to trick an administrator into adding a rule for a malicious service principal, or have the knowledge of an entitled principal's secret key. The victim principals would be limited to the ones allowed by the rules for that service.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8 and older and Red Hat Gluster Storage, Samba as an Active Directory Domain Controller is not supported, and thus is not affected by this flaw.

RHEL Identity Management (RHEL IdM) implements constrained delegation feature using Active Directory's Kerberos extensions called Service for User (S4U). The constrained delegation implementation may potentially be vulnerable if an attacker is capable to create constrained delegation rules. In RHEL IdM only administrators allowed to add constrained delegation rules and only one such rule exists by default for HTTP/..  principal on IdM server. Security of IdM server is the key to safety of the whole RHEL IdM deployment. If an attacker is able to impersonate the HTTP/.. service principal on IdM server, they would be able to overtake the whole deployment even without a Kerberos protocol vulnerability described by CVE-2020-17049. However, if an attacker cannot control any service with pre-existing constrained delegation rules and cannot force creation of the constrained delegation rules for other Kerberos services, they cannot utilize CVE-2020-17049 vulnerability against RHEL IdM.
            MITIGATION: In Red Hat Identity Management (IdM), the list of existing rules for service principals  delegation can be obtained with the following commands :
$ ipa servicedelegationrule-find
$ ipa servicedelegationtarget-find
The services allowed to delegate must all be trusted.
By default, only HTTP/<IPA host>@<REALM>, corresponding to IdM's Web UI, is allowed to delegate."

This flaw allows an attacker to trick the user into submitting a request that could perform actions as the user, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and system integrity. During community penetration testing it was found that for certain HTTP end-points FreeIPA does not ensure CSRF protection. Due to implementation details one cannot use this flaw for reflection of a cookie representing already logged-in user. An attacker would always have to go through a new authentication attempt. 
            STATEMENT: The CSRF vulnerability in ipa/session/login_password is considered a moderate issue due to the need for the attacker to trick users into submitting a request. This implies that exploitation requires user interaction for a new authentication attempt, rather than reflecting a cookie for an already logged-in user. While the vulnerability could result in a loss of confidentiality and system integrity, the specific actions and their severity are not explicitly detailed. The moderate classification suggests that, while serious, the limitations on exploitation conditions and potential impact contribute to a moderate overall severity.
            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible."

Attackers can exploit this flaw to bypass filtering or execute arbitrary code by crafting a path like /~2/foo while accessing a server with a specific user. 
            STATEMENT: In a containerized environment running SELinux in enforcing mode, such as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, this vulnerability does not allow an attacker to escape the boundary of a container. In this case no additional access is gained, there is an additional (but more complicated step) to look at files the user already has access to.

The upstream project (Curl) also rated this CVE as Low, see link in External References.

It is unlikely that Red Hat offerings are utilizing the SFTP feature of Curl, so the opportunity to exploit it may not exist. For those reasons Red Hat Product Security rates the impact as Low."

Homoglyphs are different Unicode characters that, to the naked eye, look the same.  An attacker could use homoglyphs to deceive a human reviewer by creating a malicious patch containing functions that look similar to standard library functions, such as print, but replace one character with a homoglyph. This function can then be defined in an upstream dependency to launch source code-related attacks. 
            STATEMENT: This is a flaw with the way unicode standards are implemented in the context of development environments, which have specialized requirements for rendering text. It is not a flaw in Red Hat products."

(This issue can also lead to data corruption.) NOTE: the vendor states ""only a few specific / uncommon usages of the API are at risk."" 
            STATEMENT: As per upstream this flaw cannot be exploited under normal documented use of the LZ4 library API. Also this flaw is only present in the lz4 library and the application binaries shipped with this application are not affected by it. 

Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 packages an older version of lz4 that has the flawed code. However, because OpenStack has been using RHEL's updated lz4 version since RHEL7.5 started to include it, Red Hat is not currently updating the OpenStack lz4 package."

Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks. OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks silently ignore invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates that are skipped for that certificate. A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether. Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

The X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function is documented to enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate verification implicitly. However, implementing the function does not enable the check, allowing certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass the certificate verification. Suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments, so it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function. The applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument. Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not commonly used by applications."

The optional ContentInfo fields can be set to null, even if the ""type"" is a valid value, which can lead to a null dereference error that may cause a denial of service. 
            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is classified as low severity. This is a result of a lack of proper validation in OpenSSL's handling of PKCS12 files. This vulnerability results in a potential Denial of Service scenario wherein maliciously crafted PKCS12 files may cause OpenSSL to crash due to a NULL pointer dereference. However, the impact of this issue is reduced by the fact that exploitation requires processing PKCS12 files from untrusted sources using specific OpenSSL APIs, such as PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes(), and PKCS12_newpass(). Furthermore, while a similar issue was addressed in SMIME_write_PKCS7(), its relevance is diminished as it pertains to writing data rather than parsing, hence not considered security significant. The risk of this vulnerability is limited as Red Hat offerings do not utilize images from untrusted sources by default.
            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability."

            STATEMENT: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 has a default 1024 nofile limit, thus preventing `systemd-tmpfiles` from exhausting its stack and crashing. For this reason, this flaw has been rated as having a security impact of Low on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. For more information on default ulimit values, please see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/4482841.

In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) systemd package was shipped with OCP 4.7 as a one-off instance and all the later OCP releases (4.8, 4.9) are using systemd from RHEL 8. Hence, the systemd package shipped with OCP 4.7 will not be fixed and the fix will be consumed from RHEL 8.
            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability."

            STATEMENT: Regarding the concern with D-Bus, users with the same UID are treated as the same user. As in Linux, multiple assumptions are made based on the fact that a user is identified by its UID. It is not advisable to have multiple users with different privileges and the same UID on systems where D-Bus is used. For these reasons, this vulnerability has been rated as having Low Impact."

This vulnerability allows an attacker to cause improper handling of XML data by providing a negative length value to the XML_ParseBuffer function. 
            STATEMENT: The CVE-2024-45490 vulnerability is rated as moderate severity because while it allows for memory corruption through improper argument handling in XML_ParseBuffer, the exploitability is limited. Specifically, it requires an unlikely scenario where the input passed to the function has a negative length (len < 0), which would typically not occur in well-formed applications. Moreover, while the impact includes denial of service (DoS), the conditions necessary for arbitrary code execution are non-trivial, requiring specific exploitation of memory corruption. Since it primarily leads to application crashes without an easily accessible attack vector for remote code execution, the risk is lower compared to higher-severity vulnerabilities that offer more direct pathways to exploitation.

            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is classified as Moderate severity rather than Important due to its reliance on specific conditions for exploitation. The integer overflow in dtdCopy affecting nDefaultAtts is limited to 32-bit platforms, reducing the attack surface as many modern systems operate on 64-bit architectures. Additionally, while the impact can lead to denial of service and potentially arbitrary code execution, the latter requires precise manipulation of the overflow condition, which may be non-trivial for attackers to achieve reliably. The constrained platform scope and the complexity of exploitation lower the overall severity, though it still poses a risk in environments where 32-bit systems are prevalent.

            STATEMENT: CVE-2024-45492 is categorized as a Moderate severity issue rather than Important due to the specific conditions required for exploitation and the limited scope of impact. While an integer overflow in the nextScaffoldPart function on 32-bit platforms can potentially lead to denial of service (DoS) or, in rare cases, arbitrary code execution, the vulnerability is platform-specific, affecting only 32-bit architectures with particular handling of UINT_MAX and SIZE_MAX. Additionally, exploiting the overflow for arbitrary code execution would require precise manipulation of memory, making it a less likely attack vector. The primary risk of DoS, without guaranteed escalation to remote code execution, further justifies the moderate severity classification.

            STATEMENT: The CVE-2023-48161 vulnerability in GifLib presents a Moderate severity issue rather than an Important one due to several factors. Firstly, while the vulnerability allows for a heap buffer overflow in the DumpScreen2RGB function of gif2rgb.c, exploitation requires specific conditions, such as handling a specially crafted GIF during the image-saving process. This limits the attack surface and reduces the likelihood of exploitation in typical usage scenarios. Additionally, the vulnerability does not grant immediate remote code execution or privilege escalation capabilities, further mitigating its severity. Furthermore, effective mitigation measures, such as implementing input validation and proper error handling, can reduce the risk of exploitation.
            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability."

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* Installing the same java-17-openjdk-headless package on two different systems resulted in distinct classes.jsa files getting generated. This was because the CDS archive was being generated by a post script action of the java-17-openjdk-headless package. This prevented the use of the dynamic dump feature, as the checksum in the archive would be different on each system. This is resolved in this release by using the .jsa files generated during the initial build. (RHBZ#2221655)

* Prepare for the next quarterly OpenJDK upstream release (2023-07, 17.0.8) [rhel-8] (BZ#2222368)"

Security Fix(es):

* OpenJDK: memory corruption issue on x86_64 with AVX-512 (8317121) (CVE-2023-22025)

* OpenJDK: certificate path validation issue during client authentication (8309966) (CVE-2023-22081)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* Additional validity checks in the handling of Zip64 files, JDK-8302483, were introduced in the 17.0.8 release of OpenJDK, causing the use of some valid zip files to now fail with an error. This release, 17.0.9, allows for zero-length headers and additional padding produced by some Zip64 creation tools. With both releases, the checks can be disabled using -Djdk.util.zip.disableZip64ExtraFieldValidation=true. (RHBZ#2237178)

* The /usr/bin/jfr alternative is now owned by the java-17-openjdk package (RHEL-13708)

* The jcmd tool is now provided by the java-17-openjdk-headless package, rather than java-17-openjdk-devel, to make it more accessible (RHEL-13658)"

Bug Fix(es):

* When Transparent Huge Pages (THP) are unconditionally enabled on a system, Java applications using many threads were found to have a large Resident Set Size (RSS). This was due to a race between the kernel transforming thread stack memory into huge pages and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) shattering these pages into smaller ones when adding a guard page. This release resolves this issue by getting glibc to insert a guard page and prevent the creation of huge pages. (RHEL-13930, RHEL-13931, RHEL-13934, RHEL-13935)"

A raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman(DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. 
            STATEMENT: NSS as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 does not re-use Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) keys. It reuses Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE) keys by default, but Attacking ECDH and ECDHE cipher suites are not in the scope of the Raccoon Attack and generally considered to be unaffected [1]. Further, reuse of ECDHE keys can be disabled starting in nss 3.17 [2].

For these reasons, Red Hat Product Security has marked the Severity of this flaw as Low. Please see [3] for more information about Low Severity ratings.

1. https://raccoon-attack.com/RacoonAttack.pdf pg. 13
2. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/NSS_3.17_release_notes
3. https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification
            MITIGATION: Any risk involving the ECDHE key reuse on the nss server can be mitigated by setting the SSL_REUSE_SERVER_ECDHE_KEY socket option to PR_FALSE."

Due to excessive backtracking while tarfile parses headers, an attacker may be able to trigger a denial of service via a specially crafted tar archive. 
            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is classified as moderate severity rather than important because while it does allow for a denial of service (DoS) attack via excessive backtracking in the tarfile module, it does not enable remote code execution or compromise the integrity or confidentiality of data. Exploitation requires an attacker to provide a specially crafted tar archive and relies on the victim's system processing that file, which limits the attack vector.

Versions of python36:3.6/python36 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 are marked as 'Not affected' as they just provide ""symlinks"" to the main python3 component, which provides the actual interpreter of the Python programming language.
            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability."

The software installs the version with the highest version number, even if the user had intended to obtain a private package from a private index. This only affects use of the --extra-index-url option, and exploitation requires that the package does not already exist in the public index (and thus the attacker can put the package there with an arbitrary version number). 
            STATEMENT: Although this issue affects versions of pip shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat Software Collections and Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces, Red Hat Product Security does not consider this to be a security vulnerability because per the pip documentation, this is intended behavior of pip when using the --extra-index-url flag. Therefore, this issue has been marked WONTFIX.
            MITIGATION: To protect from any unintended behavior,  use --index-url and do not use --extra-index-url OR explicitly set --index-url and use --extra-index-url."
