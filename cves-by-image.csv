This issue occurs when the e-Tugra root certificate in Certifi is removed, resulting in an unspecified error that has an unknown impact and attack vector. 
            STATEMENT: While eTurgra certificates being marked as untrusted by Mozilla is significant from a trust and security standpoint, this is still considered a low severity issue. The certificates were removed from Mozilla's root store in July 2023, indicating a proactive response to security concerns. Additionally, Red Hat does not run its own root store program, but depends on Mozilla for ssl certificates and Microsoft for signing certificates. 
These certs are included and marked as don't trust and will not be removed until Mozilla removes them. Browsers are most at risk, which already understand and parse 'don't trust after'. If python-fi is required not to trust these certs, they should parse the 'don't trust after' attribute."

This vulnerability occurs within the handle_verdef() function in the readelf.c source file. A NULL pointer dereference typically happens when a program attempts to access memory using a pointer that is not pointing anywhere (i.e., it's NULL), leading to a crash or potentially exploitable behavior. 
            STATEMENT: This incident was classified as a standard bug rather than a security concern. Crashes in standalone utilities triggered by untrusted inputs typically aren't regarded as security issues since they don't lead to privilege escalation. It's important to highlight that unless eu-readelf is instrumented with AddressSanitizer, no actual crash occurs; instead, eu-readelf simply prints a random global string.
            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability."

A malicious, authenticated service principal allowed to delegate could use this flaw to impersonate a non-forwardable user. 
            STATEMENT: As a prerequisite to be vulnerable, a Key Distribution Center (KDC) must be able to accept delegation via the `Service for User` (S4U) extensions.

Version of MIT Kerberos KDC in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (provided by the krb5-server package) only allows use of the S4U extensions when configured with an LDAP backend. Furthermore, delegations are denied by default and delegation rules must be explicitly created by an administrator, between a given service principal and its targets. Such a rule would entitle that service to use delegation to the targets.  This means that, in order to exploit the flaw, an attacker would require either to trick an administrator into adding a rule for a malicious service principal, or have the knowledge of an entitled principal's secret key. The victim principals would be limited to the ones allowed by the rules for that service.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8 and older and Red Hat Gluster Storage, Samba as an Active Directory Domain Controller is not supported, and thus is not affected by this flaw.

RHEL Identity Management (RHEL IdM) implements constrained delegation feature using Active Directory's Kerberos extensions called Service for User (S4U). The constrained delegation implementation may potentially be vulnerable if an attacker is capable to create constrained delegation rules. In RHEL IdM only administrators allowed to add constrained delegation rules and only one such rule exists by default for HTTP/..  principal on IdM server. Security of IdM server is the key to safety of the whole RHEL IdM deployment. If an attacker is able to impersonate the HTTP/.. service principal on IdM server, they would be able to overtake the whole deployment even without a Kerberos protocol vulnerability described by CVE-2020-17049. However, if an attacker cannot control any service with pre-existing constrained delegation rules and cannot force creation of the constrained delegation rules for other Kerberos services, they cannot utilize CVE-2020-17049 vulnerability against RHEL IdM.
            MITIGATION: In Red Hat Identity Management (IdM), the list of existing rules for service principals  delegation can be obtained with the following commands :
$ ipa servicedelegationrule-find
$ ipa servicedelegationtarget-find
The services allowed to delegate must all be trusted.
By default, only HTTP/<IPA host>@<REALM>, corresponding to IdM's Web UI, is allowed to delegate."

This flaw allows an attacker to trick the user into submitting a request that could perform actions as the user, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and system integrity. During community penetration testing it was found that for certain HTTP end-points FreeIPA does not ensure CSRF protection. Due to implementation details one cannot use this flaw for reflection of a cookie representing already logged-in user. An attacker would always have to go through a new authentication attempt. 
            STATEMENT: The CSRF vulnerability in ipa/session/login_password is considered a moderate issue due to the need for the attacker to trick users into submitting a request. This implies that exploitation requires user interaction for a new authentication attempt, rather than reflecting a cookie for an already logged-in user. While the vulnerability could result in a loss of confidentiality and system integrity, the specific actions and their severity are not explicitly detailed. The moderate classification suggests that, while serious, the limitations on exploitation conditions and potential impact contribute to a moderate overall severity.

In this case no additional access is gained, there is an additional (but more complicated step) to look at files the user already has access to.

The upstream project (Curl) also rated this CVE as Low, see link in External References.

It is unlikely that Red Hat offerings are utilizing the SFTP feature of Curl, so the opportunity to exploit it may not exist. For those reasons Red Hat Product Security rates the impact as Low."

Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks. OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks silently ignore invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates that are skipped for that certificate. A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether. Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is classified as low severity. This is a result of a lack of proper validation in OpenSSL's handling of PKCS12 files. This vulnerability results in a potential Denial of Service scenario wherein maliciously crafted PKCS12 files may cause OpenSSL to crash due to a NULL pointer dereference. However, the impact of this issue is reduced by the fact that exploitation requires processing PKCS12 files from untrusted sources using specific OpenSSL APIs, such as PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes(), and PKCS12_newpass(). Furthermore, while a similar issue was addressed in SMIME_write_PKCS7(), its relevance is diminished as it pertains to writing data rather than parsing, hence not considered security significant. The risk of this vulnerability is limited as Red Hat offerings do not utilize images from untrusted sources by default.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to cause improper handling of XML data by providing a negative length value to the XML_ParseBuffer function. 
            STATEMENT: The CVE-2024-45490 vulnerability is rated as moderate severity because while it allows for memory corruption through improper argument handling in XML_ParseBuffer, the exploitability is limited. Specifically, it requires an unlikely scenario where the input passed to the function has a negative length (len < 0), which would typically not occur in well-formed applications. Moreover, while the impact includes denial of service (DoS), the conditions necessary for arbitrary code execution are non-trivial, requiring specific exploitation of memory corruption. Since it primarily leads to application crashes without an easily accessible attack vector for remote code execution, the risk is lower compared to higher-severity vulnerabilities that offer more direct pathways to exploitation.

Adding a new file to the argument list triggers Buf* autocommands. In an autocommand, if the buffer that was just opened is closed, including the window where it is shown, it causes the window structure to be freed, containing a reference to the argument list that is being modified. Once the autocommands are completed, references to the window and argument list are no longer valid, causing a use-after-free issue. To trigger this issue, a local attacker or user must add unusual autocommands that wipe a buffer during creation, either manually or by sourcing a malicious plugin, which will cause Vim to crash."

When performing a search and displaying the search count message is disabled, the search pattern is shown at the bottom of the screen, and this text is stored in an internal buffer. The search pattern is reversed when using the right-left search mode, and a new internal buffer will be created. If the original search pattern contains NULL characters, the newly allocated buffer will be smaller than the required size, leading to a head-based out-of-bounds read. This flaw allows an attacker to trick the user into running the malicious search pattern and execute all the steps required to cause the out-of-bounds read.

It was assumed that this loop was unnecessary. However, this change made it possible for the cursor position to stay invalid and point beyond the end of a line, which would eventually cause a heap-buffer-overflow when trying to access the line pointer at the specified cursor position.
