This issue occurs when the e-Tugra root certificate in Certifi is removed, resulting in an unspecified error that has an unknown impact and attack vector. 
            STATEMENT: While eTurgra certificates being marked as untrusted by Mozilla is significant from a trust and security standpoint, this is still considered a low severity issue. The certificates were removed from Mozilla's root store in July 2023, indicating a proactive response to security concerns. Additionally, Red Hat does not run its own root store program, but depends on Mozilla for ssl certificates and Microsoft for signing certificates. 
These certs are included and marked as don't trust and will not be removed until Mozilla removes them. Browsers are most at risk, which already understand and parse 'don't trust after'. If python-fi is required not to trust these certs, they should parse the 'don't trust after' attribute."

            STATEMENT: This CVE is under investigation by Red Hat Product Security.

Note: Upstream would categorize this as a simple bug, not a security issue. Since most elfutils tools are run in short-lived, local, interactive, development contexts rather than remotely ""in production"", we generally treat malfunctions as ordinary bugs rather than security vulnerabilities.
The version, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, is not affected by this vulnerability."

This vulnerability occurs within the handle_verdef() function in the readelf.c source file. A NULL pointer dereference typically happens when a program attempts to access memory using a pointer that is not pointing anywhere (i.e., it's NULL), leading to a crash or potentially exploitable behavior. 
            STATEMENT: This incident was classified as a standard bug rather than a security concern. Crashes in standalone utilities triggered by untrusted inputs typically aren't regarded as security issues since they don't lead to privilege escalation. It's important to highlight that unless eu-readelf is instrumented with AddressSanitizer, no actual crash occurs; instead, eu-readelf simply prints a random global string.
            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability."

A malicious, authenticated service principal allowed to delegate could use this flaw to impersonate a non-forwardable user. 
            STATEMENT: As a prerequisite to be vulnerable, a Key Distribution Center (KDC) must be able to accept delegation via the `Service for User` (S4U) extensions.

Version of MIT Kerberos KDC in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (provided by the krb5-server package) only allows use of the S4U extensions when configured with an LDAP backend. Furthermore, delegations are denied by default and delegation rules must be explicitly created by an administrator, between a given service principal and its targets. Such a rule would entitle that service to use delegation to the targets.  This means that, in order to exploit the flaw, an attacker would require either to trick an administrator into adding a rule for a malicious service principal, or have the knowledge of an entitled principal's secret key. The victim principals would be limited to the ones allowed by the rules for that service.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8 and older and Red Hat Gluster Storage, Samba as an Active Directory Domain Controller is not supported, and thus is not affected by this flaw.

RHEL Identity Management (RHEL IdM) implements constrained delegation feature using Active Directory's Kerberos extensions called Service for User (S4U). The constrained delegation implementation may potentially be vulnerable if an attacker is capable to create constrained delegation rules. In RHEL IdM only administrators allowed to add constrained delegation rules and only one such rule exists by default for HTTP/..  principal on IdM server. Security of IdM server is the key to safety of the whole RHEL IdM deployment. If an attacker is able to impersonate the HTTP/.. service principal on IdM server, they would be able to overtake the whole deployment even without a Kerberos protocol vulnerability described by CVE-2020-17049. However, if an attacker cannot control any service with pre-existing constrained delegation rules and cannot force creation of the constrained delegation rules for other Kerberos services, they cannot utilize CVE-2020-17049 vulnerability against RHEL IdM.
            MITIGATION: In Red Hat Identity Management (IdM), the list of existing rules for service principals  delegation can be obtained with the following commands :
$ ipa servicedelegationrule-find
$ ipa servicedelegationtarget-find
The services allowed to delegate must all be trusted.
By default, only HTTP/<IPA host>@<REALM>, corresponding to IdM's Web UI, is allowed to delegate."

This flaw allows an attacker to trick the user into submitting a request that could perform actions as the user, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and system integrity. During community penetration testing it was found that for certain HTTP end-points FreeIPA does not ensure CSRF protection. Due to implementation details one cannot use this flaw for reflection of a cookie representing already logged-in user. An attacker would always have to go through a new authentication attempt. 
            STATEMENT: The CSRF vulnerability in ipa/session/login_password is considered a moderate issue due to the need for the attacker to trick users into submitting a request. This implies that exploitation requires user interaction for a new authentication attempt, rather than reflecting a cookie for an already logged-in user. While the vulnerability could result in a loss of confidentiality and system integrity, the specific actions and their severity are not explicitly detailed. The moderate classification suggests that, while serious, the limitations on exploitation conditions and potential impact contribute to a moderate overall severity.
            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible."

(This issue can also lead to data corruption.) NOTE: the vendor states ""only a few specific / uncommon usages of the API are at risk."" 
            STATEMENT: As per upstream this flaw cannot be exploited under normal documented use of the LZ4 library API. Also this flaw is only present in the lz4 library and the application binaries shipped with this application are not affected by it. 

Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 packages an older version of lz4 that has the flawed code. However, because OpenStack has been using RHEL's updated lz4 version since RHEL7.5 started to include it, Red Hat is not currently updating the OpenStack lz4 package."

Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks.

The X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function is documented to enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate verification implicitly. However, implementing the function does not enable the check, allowing certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass the certificate verification. Suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments, so it was decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function. The applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitly enable the policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument. Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not commonly used by applications."

The optional ContentInfo fields can be set to null, even if the ""type"" is a valid value, which can lead to a null dereference error that may cause a denial of service. 
            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is classified as low severity. This is a result of a lack of proper validation in OpenSSL's handling of PKCS12 files. This vulnerability results in a potential Denial of Service scenario wherein maliciously crafted PKCS12 files may cause OpenSSL to crash due to a NULL pointer dereference. However, the impact of this issue is reduced by the fact that exploitation requires processing PKCS12 files from untrusted sources using specific OpenSSL APIs, such as PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes(), and PKCS12_newpass(). Furthermore, while a similar issue was addressed in SMIME_write_PKCS7(), its relevance is diminished as it pertains to writing data rather than parsing, hence not considered security significant. The risk of this vulnerability is limited as Red Hat offerings do not utilize images from untrusted sources by default.
            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability."

This flaw allows a remote attacker to pass specially crafted data to the application, initiating an integer overflow and executing a denial of service (DoS) attack. 
            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security classifies this issue as having a Low security impact. The vulnerability involves an infinite loop in a command-line utility, which is not typically designed to handle untrusted input. As a result, it is assessed that this does not pose a substantial security risk and does not lead to any meaningful security impact.
            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability."

A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by providing a malicious SQL query that, when processed by an application linked to SQLite, would crash the application causing a denial of service. 
            STATEMENT: This flaw has been rated as having a security impact of Low. The versions of `sqlite` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux are compiled without SQLITE_DEBUG, so it's not possible to reproduce the crash. The invalid Mem object may still lead to undefined behaviors, though no notable defects have been observed."
